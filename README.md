# Hi there! I'm Meshach

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate majoring in Cybersecurity.

As a kid, my introduction to programming was teaching myself how to use Gamemaker Studio, producing small games in addition to doing the art and sound design.

Over time, I spread out into learning languages such as C, Python and Java, and developed a general love for the the dialect of problem solving we know as programming.
